<h4 align="center">Advanced XSS Detection Suite</h4>

XSS Finder is a sophisticated Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) detection suite designed for precision and efficiency.
It features four custom-built parsers, an intelligent and context-aware payload generator, a robust fuzzing engine, and a lightning-fast web crawler â€” all developed to work together seamlessly.

Instead of injecting payloads and checking it works like all the other tools do, XSS Finder analyses the response with multiple parsers and then crafts payloads that are guaranteed to work by context analysis integrated with a fuzzing engine.
Here are some examples of the payloads generated by XSS Finder:
```
}]};(confirm)()//\
<A%0aONMouseOvER%0d=%0d[8].find(confirm)>z
</tiTlE/><a%0donpOintErentER%0d=%0d(prompt)``>z
</SCRiPT/><DETAILs/+/onpoINTERenTEr%0a=%0aa=prompt,a()//
```
Apart from that, XSS Finder has crawling, fuzzing, parameter discovery, WAF detection capabilities as well. It also scans for DOM XSS vulnerabilities.
